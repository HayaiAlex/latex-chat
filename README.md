# Setup

If you want to contribute, you'll need to install Node.js (available from your package manager on Linux, or the Node website https://nodejs.org), and run npm install to install all the required packages. To run the server, and get things like livereload and automatic SASS compilation working, you'll need to run grunt. If you want to use autoprefixer, run grunt postcss.
